            <div class="">
                <p class="text"><span class="dropCap">A</span>fter living in New York City for 15 years, Myrna Lazcano, 40, realized that returning to Puebla, Mexico, was a sensible decision to take. She would have to make adjustments in terms of raising her daughters in a different country and, perhaps, opening a new business to sustain her family. It all turned out to be more dangerous than she had imagined, as they became victims of violence and organized crime.</p>

                <p class="text">Risking their lives with the narco war traumatized their aspirations, and in the summer of 2013, they decided to return to the United States. The girls and the father made their entrance with no problems. But, Myrna had to travel across the border, because she never adjusted her immigration status in the US.</p>

                <p class="text">"I was concerned that my daughters needed my care, my support and my love," Lazcano said, on her thoughts prior to the voyage where she ended up detained in an immigration prison in Florence, Arizona. Lazcano lived there for a month before being returned to Mexico.</p>

                <p class="text">She spent three years separated from her daughters until April 2016, when she was supported by a faithful sanctuary church called Sión. Father Juan Carlos Ruíz, 47, travelled to the border along with the church’s legal advisors, to intervene her second attempt to cross the border and reunite her with her family.</p>

                <p class="text">Father Ruiz and the Church of Sión are members of the Hispanic Lutheran Congregation of Saint Peter’s Church in Midtown, Manhattan. It is one of nearly 100 organizations that are part of the New Sanctuary Movement in New York City.</p>

                <div class="quoteBox"><span class="quoteLeft">"Different to the sanctuary movement that took place in the 1980's, the new sanctuary movement offers refuge to people and families. We showcase their stories to educate citizens about the inhumanity of the immigration laws and call for a reform." <strong>- Ravi Ragbir, executive director of the new sanctuary movement in New York</strong></span></div>

                <p class="text">Established in 2007, the members of this movement accompany migrants to present themselves before a court judge and support them in the adjustment of their immigration status. They facilitate access to legal assistance and welcome those who flee a possible deportation.</p>

                <p class="text">"When the judges realize that our people are not alone, they are more cautious on judging against them", said Father Ruíz, who accompanies five to six persons to court every week.</p>

                <p class="text">But, these deportations are nothing new. During the presidency of Barack Obama, an estimated 2.2 million undocumented Mexicans were returned to their country of origin. With the recent raids against immigrants in several cities of the country, uncertainty increases on the extent this type of protection can help the most vulnerable communities.</p>

                <p class="text">There is a federal policy that does not allow law enforcement officials to detain undocumented immigrants in certain locations, such as churches and schools. It is not a law, just a regulation contemplated in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement Memorandum, published in 2011 during the Obama administration, according to Alyshia Gálvez, researcher of Latino communities at Lehman College. Today it is still in force.</p>

                <p class="text">“In the United States, we don’t have many cases where violence has penetrated the walls of a church, except for the shooting in North Carolina. What is relevant is that religious leaders are willing to face a judicial process to protect these people from law enforcement,” Galvez said.</p>

                <p class="text">Among the services a sanctuary church offers are spiritual counseling, assistance with legal matters and provide a "safe space" for temporary relief in times of stress. When necessary, they also have a kitchen, bathroom and rooms to house those who could be persecuted for imminent deportation.</p>

                <div class="quoteBox"><span class="quoteRight">"This is a machinery that criminalizes and provokes fear in our communities. But the attack is not just against undocumented immigrants, but diversity in all its manifestations." <strong>- Father Juan Carlos Ruíz, from the Church of Sión</strong></span></div>

                <p class="text">At masses and meetings, the churches of the New Sanctuary Movement encourage participants to share their experience and overcome the fear of being discriminated.</p>

                <p class="text">In the church of Sión there is a space for disadvantaged communities, such as Latinos, undocumented, victims of hate crimes, LGBTQ community and many others, vulnerable to the law and the new administrative order.</p>

                <p class="text">Sión and the New Sanctuary Movement shows the human side of the conflict and promotes a better understanding of these communities within society, and a bid for legislative changes.</p>
